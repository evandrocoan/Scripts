Summary
For each tag that needs to be changed:

Go back in time to the commit representing the tag
Delete the tag (locally and remotely)
This will turn your "Release" on GitHub into a Draft that you can later delete.
Re-add the same-named tag using a magic invocation that sets its date to the date of the commit.
Push the new tags with fixed dates back up to GitHub.
Go to GitHub, delete any now-draft releases, and re-create new releases from the new tags
In code:

# Fixing tag named '1.0.1'
git checkout 1.0.1               # Go to the associated commit
git tag -d 1.0.1                 # Locally delete the tag
git push origin :refs/tags/1.0.1 # Push this deletion up to GitHub

# Create the tag, with a date derived from the current head
GIT_COMMITTER_DATE="$(git show --format=%aD | head -1)" git tag -a 1.0.1 -m"v1.0.1"

git push --tags                  # Send the fixed tags to GitHub






# This moves you to the point in history where the commit exists
git checkout SHA1_OF_PAST_COMMIT

# This command gives you the datetime of the commit you're standing on
git show --format=%aD  | head -1

# And this temporarily sets git tag's clock back to the date you copy/pasted in from above
GIT_COMMITTER_DATE="Thu, 26 Feb 2009 12:00:32 -0200" git tag -a v1.1.290 -m "2009-02-26 | v1.1.290

 * Added a check for valid map when populating the various map listings from map list files.
 * Fixed error whem empty server map file doesn't exist.
 * Fixed issue whereas Galileo would set the time limit to 0 in the course of it's regular
   activities but then sometimes not reset it to the original time limit afterwards.
 * No longer tries to print menus in color if the game mod doesn't support colored menus.
 * Fixed possible RTV exploit by introducing a delay before a single player can RTV after a
    map change. It's the lesser of either 2 minutes or the value of gal_rtv_wait.
 * Added additional information to comments for gal_nom_mapfile, gal_vote_mapfile, and
    gal_emptyserver_mapfile in galileo.cfg.
 * Changed default for gal_nom_prefixes from 1 to 0. In other words, the prefix functionality
    will be turned off by default.
 * Will no longer overwrite an existing menu. This means if a player has another menu open when
   the map vote starts, they won't see the map vote until the other menu is closed. It also means
   that, after a player voted and if the server is showing the vote progress, if another menu
   overwrites Galileo's, the progress won't be shown again until the other menu has been closed.
   This only affects people that show the in-progress vote status.
 * Now obeys a setting of '0' for gal_endofmapvote. Would previously erroneously present a vote
   regardless of the setting.
 * New CVAR, gal_sounds_mute, to indicate if any of the sentences spoken during various events are
   muted. See galileo.cfg for more information.
 * Added code to handle automated version info from SVN. This is of no consequence to anyone but
   me really, but I wanted to include it in the change log since it actually involves a change
   to the code.
 * Removed benign code that was prepped for feature utilizing standard maps of each mod. There
   is no longer any plans to add any information regarding standard maps as I see no use for it.
 * Removed the following language keys:
   GAL_STANDARD_NOTFOUND
   GAL_STANDARD_TOOMANY
   GAL_STANDARD_UNKNOWNMOD
 * Fixed the 'vote filler groups' feature that was previously working incorrectly.

# Combining the two...

However, if you have already added the tag, you cannot use the above with git tag -f existingtag or else git will complain when you try to merge
